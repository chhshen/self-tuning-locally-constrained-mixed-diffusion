This package contains cleaned up code for the above paper.

Important files are: (see the paper for detail)

1) test.m: demo code for MPEG-7 shape database
2) selfAdaptDistance2: find the Self-Adaptive Neighborhood (SAN) size
3) affinityMatrix6.m: convert distance matrix to affinity matrix
4) matrixCo1.m: construct a new affinity matrix from the input affinity matrices
5) DominantNeighbor.m: find the donimant set of the input initial kNN
6) matrixAffinityCo1.m run LCDP

Comments from the author -Jul. 27 2014-
The code is submitted to IEEE explore with the paper in early 2013.
However, it seems not available to the public and someone sent me mail asking for the code.
I think github is a good place to share code.
Hope it can help someone in any way.
